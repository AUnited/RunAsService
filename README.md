# RunAsService
RunAsService is a command line tool that allows you to setup a regular  console application to run as a service.

This tool requires that .NET Framework 4.0 be already installed on your computer.
If you do not have .NET Framework 4.0 this tool will display a message and not run.
You probably already have the .NET Framework 4.0 but if you don't you can download 
it here: Microsoft Download Center

IMPORTANT: Any services you install using this tool will
require that this tool remain on that computer in the same
location in order for those services to continue functioning. Therefore
before installing any services you should make sure this tool is
somewhere where it can remain permanently. If you do end up moving
this tool use the 'fixservices' action to fix the existing services.
(details on how to use 'fixservices' can be found below)

    RunAsService
        Typing just the name of the tool without specifying any parameters.
        Or specifying incorrect paramters will bring you to the help screen.

    RunAsService install [Name] [Display Name] PathToExecutable
        Name
            The name of the service, if none is specified the name 
            will default to the name of the executable.

            You might choose to give it a different name than 
            the executable to keep some kind of existing convention, 
            make it friendlier or make it easier to use commands like 
            'net start' and 'net stop'
    
        Display Name
            This is how the service name will be displayed in the windows
            services list. If no display name is specified it will default
            to Name, if Name is not specified, it will default to the name
            of the executable.

            Generally the display name is longer and more descriptive
            than the name and gives the user a better idea of what
            the service is and/or does.

        PathToExecutable
            The location of the application you want to run as a service.
        
            Note, the tool will check if this executable exists, if it
            doesn't find it will not install it.

    RunAsService uninstall Name
        Name
            The name of the service you would like to uninstall.

    RunAsService fixservices
            Use this action when you've moved the RunAsService executable.
            Services installed using RunAsService require that RunAsService
            remain on the computer and at the same location if
            you move it the services will stop working, use this
            action to fix that.

# EXAMPLES


Installs Myapp as a service called "Myapp"

    RunAsService install "c:\my apps\Myapp.exe"
    
Installs Myapp as a service called "My Service"

    RunAsService install "My Service" "c:\my apps\Myapp.exe"

Installs Myapp as a service internally called "My Service" when 
using commands like 'net start' and 'net stop' and shows up as 
"My Super Cool Service" in Window's services list.

    RunAsService install "My Service" "My Super Cool Service" "c:\my apps\Myapp.exe"

Uninstalls the service.
        
    RunAsService uninstall "My Service"

Use this action if you move this tool. This is because services
installed using this tool rely on this tool remaining on that 
computer and at the same location. If you do not call 'fixservices'
after moving this tool the existing services installed using this
tool will stop functioning.

    RunAsService fixservices

# NOTES

You can use Windows built in commands to start and stop your services. For example you can use:

        net start "My Service"
        
and

        net stop "My Service"
    
Where "My Service" would be replaced with the name of your service.
